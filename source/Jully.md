# Jully's Profile
Hi I'm Jully! I'm from Shanghai, I love animals, especially dogs.
Besides DT stuffs I also do illustrations, graphic designs. A lot of my projects are about animals.

<b>Mushroom observstion is my new hobby</b>

It's fun to watch them growing and die, and intreseting thing about getting familiar with mushrooms is that I can know which are edible mushooms and which are toxic.
